SUPER-CHARGED THEMES WITH A TEMPLATE LANGUAGE
Twig, the most popular PHP template language, unlocks new possibilities for theme designers. In this session, I’ll introduce the benefits of working with Twig and some of the coolest features that empower template developers entirely new concepts to manipulate their WordPress themes. I’ll provide specific examples in how major media companies use WordPress and Twig to make sustainable themes that can live-on and be extended for years to come.


### The problem with WordPress
- Yes, PHP is a template language
- A lot has happened in the internet since PHP became a "template language"
- Smarty, the "cave painting" of template languages
- Stupid JS hacking
  - fetching a user avatar
- Handlebars
- Django, Ruby on Rails, Node
- Drupal, Craft, Laravel, Expression Engine
- Look back at PHP, is it really a template language?
- Look at WordPress template file, risks:
  - Closing of HTML tags
  - Closing of PHP tags (WSOD)
  - linear contruction (header/footer)
  - linear building (design -> dev)
